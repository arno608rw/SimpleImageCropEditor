SimpleImageCropEditor
=====================

Image cropping ( cropper ) and image grayscale editor for iOS. This is an open source library and example for iOS developers. 

This project was created to show Image Processing skill set (future contract job) and since I used an open source example contributions from others I thought it should be shared. Plus, I would like to acknowledge others for all the examples posted within GitHub. 

How to Use: A snapshot is taken using the system camera. This image is retained in runtime memory and orientation translation is applied. The option to crop, zoom, and save the edited image is applied. Conversion to grayscale is applied and the option to save or leave as is. Then the final feature allows the user to email the image or photo that is in current retained/run-time memory. The file is converted to PNG and loaded as an email attachment. 

Demonstrates, is example source Objective-C code, use of UIImagePickerController, @protocol, UIActionSheet, UIScrollView, UINavigationController, MFMailComposeViewController, and UIGestureRecognizer. 

This project was created using and refactoring open source GitHub projects "kishikawakatsumi/PEPhotoCropEditor" and "iosdeveloper/ImageCropper". Be sure to tip your hat to these developers. 

Please contact me if you need to hire an iOS Developer Contractor. Be sure you are funded and have solid specifications to review.  Ideas are great, but make sure you write out a specification before contacting me.  Be sure to visit mobilesandbox.com and passwordcaptain.com for more recent iOS example work.
