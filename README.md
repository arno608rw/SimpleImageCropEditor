SimpleImageCropEditor
=====================

(Be sure to UP-VOTE the link on stackoverflow.com if this was helpful. Plus you could add a star to this github open source project, above, if deserving)

Image cropping ( cropper ) and image grayscale editor for iOS. This is an open source library and example for iOS developers. 

This project was created to show Image Processing skill set and since I used an open source example contributions from others I thought it should be shared. Plus, I would like to acknowledge others for all the examples posted within GitHub.com and StackOverFlow.com . 

How to Use: A snapshot is taken using the system camera. This image is retained in runtime memory and orientation translation is applied. The option to crop, zoom, and save the edited image is applied. Conversion to grayscale is applied and the option to save or leave as is. Then the final feature allows the user to email the image or photo that is in current retained/run-time memory. The file is converted to PNG and loaded as an email attachment. 

Demonstrates, example source Objective-C code, use of UIImagePickerController, @protocol, UIActionSheet, UIScrollView, UINavigationController, MFMailComposeViewController, and UIGestureRecognizer.
